## Project Description:
This project required students to setup Git account, link said account to user's cloud9 workspace, and learn about Version Control.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One concept learned in this lesson is that of Verson control. Version control is a central, remote repository that holds project files and allows multiple users to access said files.
2. Another concept learned is how a Version Control System functions. A version control system is created and files are uploaded. These files are then made available to other users who can then "check out" the files, edit them, and "check" the files back in. Each edit and revision is saved as a separate files so that earlier revisions can be accessed.
3. Another concept learned is the benefits of using Version Control for file sharing. Version Control solved the file sharing problem! A great benefit of using version control is that multiple users can edit the same files from different remote devices at the exact same time without any conflict. Because files are never overwritten and all edits are saved, all members have access to every edit.
